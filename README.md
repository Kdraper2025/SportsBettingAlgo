# NBA Game Outcome Predictor

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the outcome of NBA games. The model leverages 40 years of historical NBA data to achieve a high accuracy rate, providing valuable insights for enthusiasts and analysts alike.

## Objectives
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Develop a model with a high accuracy rate for predicting NBA game outcomes.
- **Automated Data Collection**: Implement a system for automated daily scraping of new game data.
- **Financial Projection**: Estimate potential earnings based on the model's predictions.

## Data
The dataset comprises 40 years of historical NBA game data, sourced from a trusted platform. The data extraction and cleaning processes were carried out using Pandas and BeautifulSoup.

## Methodology
1. **Data Scraping and Cleaning**:
   - Utilized Pandas and BeautifulSoup to scrape historical NBA data.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure quality and consistency.
   - Automated the daily scraping process to update the dataset with new game data.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Employed various machine learning models, including logistic regression and neural networks.
   - Conducted thorough data analysis and feature engineering to enhance model performance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Achieved a 75% accuracy rate in predicting game outcomes.
   - Projected an earning of approximately $700 based on the model's performance.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: The predictive model achieved an accuracy rate of 75% in determining NBA game outcomes.
- **Financial Projection**: Based on the model's predictions, an estimated earning of $700 was projected.
